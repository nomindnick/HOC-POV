Good morning team,

Please join me for our monthly leadership meeting this Thursday at 2 PM in the conference room.

Agenda:
1. Budget review for next fiscal year
2. Enrollment projections
3. Leadership development program updates
4. New state testing requirements
5. Technology initiative rollout

We'll need strong leadership as we navigate these budget constraints. Please come prepared to lead discussions in your respective areas.

The leadership team's input is critical for our strategic planning.

See you Thursday,
Dr. Patricia Williams
Superintendent
