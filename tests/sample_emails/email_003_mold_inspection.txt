Dear Facilities Team,

During our routine inspection today, we discovered significant mold growth in the basement of Building C. The affected area appears to be approximately 50 square feet along the north wall.

Findings:
- Black mold (Stachybotrys) confirmed via visual inspection
- Moisture readings at 85% (well above acceptable 50%)
- Evidence of water intrusion from foundation crack
- Musty odor detectable in adjacent classrooms

Immediate recommendations:
1. Close off affected area
2. Improve ventilation
3. Schedule professional remediation
4. Fix water intrusion source
5. Conduct air quality testing in adjacent rooms

This requires urgent attention due to potential health risks to students and staff.

Please contact me at 555-0123 to discuss remediation plans.

Sincerely,
Tom Wilson
