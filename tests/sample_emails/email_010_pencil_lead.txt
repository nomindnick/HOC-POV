Hi School Nurse,

One of my students asked me if the lead in pencils is toxic. I know it's actually graphite, not lead, but I wanted to get the official answer from you to share with the class.

Also, while we're on the topic, do we still use those old-fashioned lead pencil sharpeners? I remember hearing something about them being a concern.

This came up during our science unit on minerals and elements.

Thanks for your help!
