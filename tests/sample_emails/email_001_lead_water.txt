Hi Team,

I wanted to follow up on the water testing we conducted last week. The lab results came back and they found 19 ppb lead in the east hallway fountain near Room 12. This exceeds the EPA action level of 15 ppb.

We need to take immediate action:
1. Shut off the fountain immediately
2. Post warning signs
3. Provide bottled water as an alternative
4. Schedule remediation

Please confirm receipt of this email and let me know when the fountain has been shut off.

Thanks,
John Smith
Facilities Manager
