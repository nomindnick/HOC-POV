Dear Principal,

I'm writing to express my concern about peeling paint I noticed in my daughter's classroom (Room 203). Given the age of the building (built in 1965), I'm worried this might be lead-based paint.

Has the school tested for lead paint? If not, I'd like to request testing be done as soon as possible.

I spoke with the lead counselor about my concerns, but she referred me to you since this is a facilities issue rather than a counseling matter.

Please let me know what steps will be taken to address this potential hazard.

Thank you,
Jennifer Martinez
Parent of Emma Martinez (3rd grade)
